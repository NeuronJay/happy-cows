    "\n",
    "Dairy producers of all sizes are under an ever-present economic pressure to produce more with less to meet the global demand for dairy products.  As a result, farmers need to carefully monitor the environments of their cattle to prevent injury, encourage production, and stop the spread of disease.  As a result, careful examination of input factors such as genetics, nutrition, climate, facilities, and negative health-events may provide actionable insights into ways to modify operations and improve the health, well-being, and production of their herds."

The current scope of analysis can be grouped into the following facilities and weather, herd composition, and nutrition.  As a greater breadth of data becomes, available additional insights may be drawn.  This analysis focuses on milk production data for calendar years 2016 and 2017."

    "\n",
    "In the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, Franklin County experienced a total of 6 days of where the average of 3 weather stations recorded maximum temperatures greater than 90 degrees, and 33 days where a low of temperature less than 10 degrees was recorded.  The volume of milk produced during and immediately after the extreme temperature days did not see a statistically significant impact on production volumes. As a result, current data suggest that existing facilities and practices have proven sufficiently effective for heat and cold abatement.  The current recommendation is to maintain existing ventilation, cooling, insulation and heating strategies.  Additional capital investment to improve these facilities and practices beyond regular maintenance may not lead to improved milk volumes.  "
