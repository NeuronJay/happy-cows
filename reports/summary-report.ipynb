    "\n",
    "Dairy producers of all sizes are under an ever-present economic pressure to produce more with less to meet the global demand for dairy products.  As a result, farmers need to carefully monitor the environments of their cattle to prevent injury, encourage production, and stop the spread of disease.  As a result, careful examination of input factors such as genetics, nutrition, climate, facilities, and negative health-events may provide actionable insights into ways to modify operations and improve the health, well-being, and production of their herds."

The current scope of analysis can be grouped into the following facilities and weather, herd composition, and nutrition.  As a greater breadth of data becomes, available additional insights may be drawn.  This analysis focuses on milk production data for calendar years 2016 and 2017."

    "Older cattle having gone through at least three lactations, outperformed younger cattle by 17.5% for the first 305 days after calving, with an average of 24,435 milk-pounds (2,841 gallons) compared to 20,789 milk-pounds (2,417 gallons).  The performance gap is most pronounced in the 20-100 day post-calving range but gradually decreased to zero until approximately 400 days after calving.  The wide range for milk-weights beyond 400 days are believed to be the result of incomplete calving data.

The volume of milk produced during and immediately after the extreme temperature days did not see a statistically significant impact on production volumes.
