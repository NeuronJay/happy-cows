    "\n",
    "Dairy producers of all sizes are under an ever-present economic pressure to produce more with less to meet the global demand for dairy products.  As a result, farmers need to carefully monitor the environments of their cattle to prevent injury, encourage production, and stop the spread of disease.  As a result, careful examination of input factors such as genetics, nutrition, climate, facilities, and negative health-events may provide actionable insights into ways to modify operations and improve the health, well-being, and production of their herds."

    "Older cattle having gone through at least three lactations, outperformed younger cattle by 17.5% for the first 305 days after calving, with an average of 24,435 milk-pounds (2,841 gallons) compared to 20,789 milk-pounds (2,417 gallons).  The performance gap is most pronounced in the 20-100 day post-calving range but gradually decreased to zero until approximately 400 days after calving.

The volume of milk produced during and immediately after the extreme temperature days did not see a statistically significant impact on production volumes. As a result, current data suggest that existing facilities and practices have proven sufficiently effective for heat and cold abatement.
